# DiscordBot-Yaameteh

**This bot is currently obsolete as youtube discontinued all bots related to music** but the moderation commands still works.

I made a discord bot just to learn and practice python.

[**Invite The Bot** ](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=859417622290628628&permissions=3019369558&scope=bot)


P.S: Although the invite link doesn't work anymore because of TOS change of replit, discord, youtube and reddit but nevertheless it was a fun project to build that took more than 2 months on and off adding all the features and learning new things about python.
You can do what you wish with the code.  Have fun coding!
